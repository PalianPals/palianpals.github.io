### 2. Kindness is Top Priority 💯
Treat everyone with respect. No hate, discrimination, bullying, or toxic behavior.  
We’re here to **lift each other up, not bring anyone down**.

### 3. Be a Helpful Neighbor 🏡
Whether someone is asking where to find glow worms or how to host a housing party, please always lend a hand!  
We all started somewhere, and a little kindness goes a long way.
