# Breeding

Below you will find all information gathered within the **community and external sources combined**.
Breeding allows you to combine **two of the same animal species** to produce a new offspring. This is a core mechanic for improving your collection and passing on desirable traits.  

---

## 🐾 How Breeding Works
- You need **two animals of the same type** (e.g., two pekis, two ormuu, etc.).  
- When paired, they will produce a **baby of the same species**.  
- Each parent can contribute up to **five traits** with the **Fanciest Breed Biscuit**.  
- The offspring is generated with a **mix of inherited and possible new traits**.

## 🌱 Trait Inheritance
Each animal can have up to **6 traits**. 

| Inheritance Source | Chance (example) | Notes |
|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| Parent A trait     | 40–50%           | May override Parent B’s trait |
| Parent B trait     | 40–50%           | Same chance as Parent A |
| Mutation (new)     | 5–10%            | Rare, introduces new traits |

> ⚠️ Exact percentages are unknown but this is to give a feeling on how it works.  

Traits can include:  
- **Cosmetic traits**
- **Functional traits**

## 🔄 Breeding Limits
- **Cooldown**: Parents will need rest time before breeding again , which could be solved with **Go Next Cookie**.
