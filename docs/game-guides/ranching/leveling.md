## 🍽️ Best Way to Level
The **most effective method** to quickly level up Ranching is by having animals with the traits:  

- **Healthy Eater V (5)** → Grants **the highest XP gains** when feeding animals.
- **Any Production speed/gain trait** -> Grants **the highest XP gains** when gathering from animals.

This drastically speeds up leveling since feeding and gathering becomes the most rewarding source of XP.

- Focus on breeding animals with **Any Healthy Eater trait** and **Production speed/gain traits**.
