# Cooking Stations 


All the cooking stations & how to start a recipe explained.<br /> <br /> 

Below are the six cooking stations the game has.<br /> 
<br /> 
To cook ALL recipes available you will need 2 stations of each in your house.<br /> 
Some recipes are started at the same station that you also need for your ingredients. <br /> 
So, for example, some dishes started on a stove, like Chili Oil Dumpings, also need rice to be cooked on a stove. <br /> 
You'd need a second stove to cook the rice on.<br /> 
I will explain more about how you can see what you need below.

| Image | Name | Usage | How to Obtain  | 
|:-----:|------|--------|-------------|
|![CampFire](./img/CampFire.png)| Campfire | Only used for smaller dishes that have 1 ingredient and cannot be cooked together. This is also where you make the **Fisherman's Brew** to help with your fishing adventures. | Craftable at your Workstation for: <br /> 5 Sapwood - 10 Stone - 2 Flint - 10 Plant Fiber |
|![GrillMaster](./img/GrillMaster.png)| Grill Master v3000 | Just an upgrade for the Campfire above, it can cook the same recipes. It is however a one of a kind quest item. | **The GrillMaster** is obtained by the Player during the quest **It Must Flow** and cannot be crafted. **It Must Flow** is a **Found Item Quest** started by interacting with an empty spice rack in the kitchen of Hodari and Najuma's House. |
|![Stove](./img/Stove.png)| Standard Stove | Very recognizable work station. | Craftable at your Workstation for: <br />12 Stone - Brick 5 Ceramic - 2 Copper Bar |

 <br /> 
üç≥**The steps** <br /> 
The steps show how long or complicated a recipe is, the more steps, the more time you get, but they're also harder to complete on your own.<br /> <br />

üç≥**Required Produce** <br /> 
This shows you wich produce and other ingredients you need to complete the recipe.<br /> 
You do not have to have all ingredients yourself, if a friend can step in and add the missing ingredient you both get the dishes!!<br /> 
If you're cooking alone, then you DO have to have all ingredients.<br /> <br />

You can also use starred ingredients, but you need to enable this **before** you start the recipe.<br />
