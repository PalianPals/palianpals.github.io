 <br /> 
## üç≥**The steps**üç≥ 
The steps show how long or complicated a recipe is, the more steps, the more time you get, but they're also harder to complete on your own.<br /> <br /> <img width="1335" height="792" alt="CHAPAA3x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38991666-8479-4a66-a9fc-a0f55b67e125" />

 <br /> 
 
## üç≥**Starting Ingredients**üç≥ 
This simply shows wich ingredients are needed to start a recipe, without these you cannot start the recipe.<br /> 
Some recipes, like the Bean Burger, don't require an ingredient to start the recipe.<br /> 
![STARTING](./img/Screenshots/STARTING.png) <br /> <br /> 


**## üç≥**Required Produce**üç≥ **
This shows you wich produce and other ingredients you need to complete the recipe.<br /> 
If you're cooking alone, then you DO have to have all ingredients.<br />
You do not have to have all ingredients yourself, if a friend can step in and add the missing ingredient you both get the dishes!!<br />  <br /> 
![REQUIRED](./img/Screenshots/REQUIRED.png) <br /> <br /> 

You can also use starred ingredients, but you need to enable this **before** you start the recipe.<br />
This allows you to use starred ingredients, but does not limit the use of unstarred ingredients.<br />
Without this option enabled your starred ingredients will not be taken.<br /> <br />
When you're ready to cook, press "MAKE". <br /> <br />

After you've pressed "MAKE" you will presented with a lot of icons above the cooking stations.<br />
Each indicating which ingredient or produce you need to prepare.<br /><br />

### üéÆ**The minigames**üéÆ
When you interact with a cooking station you can choose which ingredient you wish you prepare. <br /> <br />
![COOK2](./img/Screenshots/COOK2.png) <br /> <br />
And when you pick an ingredient to prepare you will be presented with a minigame.
| Chopping | Flipping  | Mixing |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|

|![GIFCHOP](./img/Screenshots/GIFCHOP.gif)|![GIFFLIP](./img/Screenshots/GIFFLIP.gif)|![GIFMIX](./img/Screenshots/GIFMIX.gif)|
<br />
The hand and the check mark mean the ingredient is ready, the people icon means that someone is busy preparing. <br /> <br />

![COOK4](./img/Screenshots/COOK4.png) 

And all ingredients that are ready to add to your dish are shown at the bottom of your screen aswell. <br /><br />

![COOK5](./img/Screenshots/COOK5.png)

Make sure you pay attention to the station you started on! Sometimes you need to stir the dish in between preparing the ingredients.<br /><br />

![COOK3](./img/Screenshots/COOK3.png)

## ‚úÖ**Finishing a dish**‚úÖ

Use the cooking station you started at to add all ingredients and your dish is ready!!<br />
And if everything went well, you will have your dish ready to collect. <br />
Using ![star](./img/STAR2.png) starred ingredients will increse the chance of a ![star](./img/STAR2.png) starred dish! <br />
But if things went slighty wrong you might be presented with Ruined Food. <br />
| Un-starred Food | ![star](./img/STAR1.png) Starred Food  | 
|:-:|:-:|
| Non-starred food will give less focus on consumption<br /> and will have a lower gold value. | ![star](./img/STAR1.png) Starred Food gives more focus and has a higher gold value.  <br /> And can be placed in and around your house as decoration! |
|![MASALANOSTAR](./img/Screenshots/MASALANOSTAR.png) | ![MASALASTAR](./img/Screenshots/MASALASTAR.png) |
| **Un-starred Ruined Food** | ![star](./img/STAR1.png) **Starred Ruined Food**  | 
| Non-starred ruined food is a junk item <br /> and can be sold for ![GOLD](./img/GOLD.png) 5 Gold. | ![star](./img/STAR1.png) Starred Ruined Food is still classified as junk, it sells for ![GOLD](./img/GOLD.png) 7 Gold.  <br />  But it can also be placed in and around your house as decoration! |

## üí∞**Gold Value**üí∞
Prices of the same dish might vary a lot, it depends on the value of the ingredients, the meat, the difference between Heat Root or Dari Cloves, the value of your fish. <br />
The higher the value of the ingredients, the higher the value of your dish. <br />
And cooking with friends divides the initial cost of ingredients per person. <br />
That's why cooking with friends or in one of our events is great to gain some money or a lot of focus food!!<br /><br />
**See you soon!** <br /><br />
