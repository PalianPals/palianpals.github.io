# Start cooking!
<br /> 
🍳To start a recipe you simple interact with one of the stations and choose your recipe.<br /> 
You will see:<br /> 
The dish, the steps, additional stations, starting ingredients📌, & required produce. <br /> 
(📌Some recipes do not have **starting ingredients**) <br /> <br /> <br />

 <br /> 
## 🍳**The steps**🍳 
The steps show how long or complicated a recipe is, the more steps, the more time you get, but they're also harder to complete on your own.<br /> <br /> <img width="1335" height="792" alt="CHAPAA3x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38991666-8479-4a66-a9fc-a0f55b67e125" />

## 🍳**Starting Ingredients**🍳 
This simply shows wich ingredients are needed to start a recipe, without these you cannot start the recipe.<br /> 
Some recipes, like the Bean Burger, don't require an ingredient to start the recipe.<br />

**## 🍳**Required Produce**🍳 **
This shows you wich produce and other ingredients you need to complete the recipe.<br /> 
If you're cooking alone, then you DO have to have all ingredients.<br />
You do not have to have all ingredients yourself, if a friend can step in and add the missing ingredient you both get the dishes!!<br />  <br />

You can also use starred ingredients, but you need to enable this **before** you start the recipe.<br />
This allows you to use starred ingredients, but does not limit the use of unstarred ingredients.<br />
Without this option enabled your starred ingredients will not be taken.<br /> <br />
When you're ready to cook, press "MAKE". <br /> <br />
