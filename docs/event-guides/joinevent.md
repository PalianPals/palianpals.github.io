## Step 1: Check Event Details

- Open the **Discord server** and navigate to the channel corresponding to the day of the event.  
- Look at the **event announcement** for date, time, and requirements.  
- Make sure you have **all items, tools, and consumables** needed for the event.

## Step 2: RSVP (Sign up for the event)

We make use of **Sesh** for event sign-ups:  

1. Open the **Discord server** and navigate to the channel corresponding to the day of the event.  
2. Click **ONE of the roles** to sign up for the event (this can be a team or a ingredient in case of cooking events).  
3. Make sure your RSVP is confirmed — you may receive a notification or confirmation message.  

> ⚠️ Note: Some events have limited spots — RSVP early to secure your place to avoid been waitlisted!

If the selected role is full, you will be placed on a **waitlist** in the order you signed up.  
If someone does not show, we will contact you to join the event based on your position on the list. 
This ensures fairness for everyone. 

**Do NOT sync unless the host tells you to sync.**
